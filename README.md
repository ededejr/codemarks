### codemarks

A simple vscode extension for annotating your code.

Codemarks elevates the concept of _code bookmarking_ to a new level. Tag different sections of your codebase using managed identifiers that provide valuable context to your team. Some of my favorite use cases include marking code flows and linking them to unit tests, as well as tracking patterns and annotating potential areas for improvement.

> note: this entire thing is experimental, it sure was fun though.
